# Django Silly Auth

## Why one more authentication system for Django and DRF? again !

I've used a few ones, and did not find the one that behaves the way I want,
efficient, but flexible, I wanted to gain som time, and get what I need straight to the point.

The aim of DSA it to provide a good-enough-to-go authentication out of the box, but still remains highly
modular through its SILLY_AUTH config in **settings.py**, so it is always possible to improve your
authentication when you have the time for it.

## DRF and Django Classic supported
DSA works as well with both DRF and Classic, just use differents simple settings, and you're done.
